// ===================================================================================
// CREATIVITY AND EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS:
// 1. Expanded Scripture Library: The program maintains an expanded library of 10 
//    diverse scriptures from different volumes of holy text (both single-verse and 
//    multi-verse ranges). It randomly selects one to load on startup.
// 2. Pure Random Selection (Stretch Challenge): When hiding words, the program 
//    identifies only currently visible words. This prevents double-hitting hidden 
//    words, keeping performance optimal and avoiding infinite loops at the end.
// ===================================================================================
